Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants the code rewritten to match the provided images, which include desktop and mobile designs, as well as active states. They also want comments explaining the code.

First, I need to understand the content from the images. The desktop-design.jpg and mobile-design.jpg show a product page for a perfume. The desktop version has a side-by-side layout with an image on the left and text on the right. The mobile version stacks these elements vertically. The active-states.jpg probably shows hover effects or button states.

Looking at the previous code provided, it uses flexbox for layout and has media queries for responsiveness. But the user mentioned that the images have specific text structures. For example, "PERFUME" is a category header, followed by the product name split into lines like "Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum". The price is $149.99 with the original price struck through. The button says "Add to Cart".

I notice that in the initial code, the HTML structure might not exactly match the text hierarchy in the images. For instance, "PERFUME" is missing in the previous code. Also, the product name was split into separate headings, but in the images, it's a single title with line breaks. The price section needs to display both the current and original prices side by side.

The mobile design has a different text layout, with the product name in two lines. The content also mentions "Add to Cart" in the mobile image, which was already in the previous code. The active states likely refer to hover effects on the button, which were partially handled with a background color change.

To match the images, I need to adjust the HTML structure. Adding a "PERFUME" category text above the product name. The product title should be a single heading but split into lines using <br> tags. The price section should have the current price and the original price with a line-through. The button needs to be styled with appropriate padding and hover effects.

For responsiveness, the media queries should switch the layout from row to column at a breakpoint, maybe around 768px. The image should adjust its height on mobile to prevent it from being too tall. The text sizes should also scale down on smaller screens.

Including comments in both HTML and CSS will help explain each section's purpose. Using semantic class names like "product-category", "product-title", "product-description" will make the code clearer. The CSS should handle the layout with flexbox, ensure the image takes full height on desktop, and adjust for mobile. Styling the text elements with appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing to match the images.

Testing the code to ensure that the layout shifts correctly on mobile, the image resizes without distortion, and the hover effects on the button work as intended. Also, checking that the original price is struck through and the prices are aligned horizontally.

Potential issues to watch for: image aspect ratio, line breaks in the product title, correct application of media queries, and ensuring all text elements match the images in terms of content and styling. Adding comments to each section to explain the purpose of the HTML elements and CSS rules will make the code more understandable.
